/**
 * This is the Interface which every OutputProcessor must implement.
 * The order of processors is defined by:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link org.apache.xml.security.stax.ext.XMLSecurityConstants.Phase} (required)</li>
 *     <li>
 *         Action order (optional): allows grouping processors per action without them accidentally being reordered
 *         incorrectly by processors of unrelated other action.
 *         It helps grouping processors where before/after processor classes doesn't cut it:
 *         signature-after-encryption is a valid use case, but also encryption-after-signature.
 *         There is no absolute ordering of signature processors versus encryption processors.
 *         That is where the action order comes in: whichever action comes first, it groups those processors together
 *         such they can't accidentally get mingled in between processors of unrelated actions.
 *         It's optional, if you set the action order to {@code -1} it will be ignored.
 *         The action order thus only defines the order between two processors if <i>both</i> these processors have an
 *         action order != {@code -1}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Before/after processors based on processor classes (optional): this allows ordering of processors typically
 *         belonging to a single action.</li>
 * </ol>
